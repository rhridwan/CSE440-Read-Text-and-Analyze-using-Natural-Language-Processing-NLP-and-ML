            "      it; nobody resembling the Spaniard entered or left the tavern door. The\n",
            "      night promised to be a fair one; so Tom went home with the understanding\n",

            "      started!”“I’d never ’a’ thought of the towel, I bet!”“Well, I would. My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost it.”“Say, Tom, did you see that box?”“Huck, I didn’t wait to look around. I didn’t see the\n",

            "      enough. If there’d been three, he’d be drunk enough and I’d\n",
            "      do it.”There was a long pause for reflection, and then Tom said:“Lookyhere, Huck, less not try that thing any more till we know\n",

            "      Joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a moment, and\n",
            "      Becky took the chief place in the boy’s interest. He saw her and\n",
            "      they had an exhausting good time playing “hispy” and “gully-keeper”\n",
            "      with a crowd of their schoolmates. The day was completed and crowned in a\n",
            "      peculiarly satisfactory way: Becky teased her mother to appoint the next\n",
            "      day for the long-promised and long-delayed picnic, and she consented. The\n",
            "      child’s delight was boundless; and Tom’s not more moderate.\n",
            "      The invitations were sent out before sunset, and straightway the young\n",
            "      folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation and\n",
            "      pleasurable anticipation. Tom’s excitement enabled him to keep awake\n",
            "      until a pretty late hour, and he had good hopes of hearing Huck’s\n",
            "      “maow,” and of having his treasure to astonish Becky and the\n",
            "      picnickers with, next day; but he was disappointed. No signal came that\n",
            "      night.Morning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o’clock a giddy and\n",
            "      rollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher’s, and everything\n",
            "      was ready for a start. It was not the custom for elderly people to mar the\n",
            "      picnics with their presence. The children were considered safe enough\n",
            "      under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young\n",
            "      gentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts. The old steam ferry-boat was\n",
            "      chartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the main\n",
            "      street laden with provision-baskets. Sid was sick and had to miss the fun;\n",
            "      Mary remained at home to entertain him. The last thing Mrs. Thatcher said\n",
            "      to Becky, was:“You’ll not get back till late. Perhaps you’d better\n",
            "      stay all night with some of the girls that live near the ferry-landing,\n",

            "      trouble.”Presently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky:“Say—I’ll tell you what we’ll do. ’Stead of\n",
            "      going to Joe Harper’s we’ll climb right up the hill and stop\n",
            "      at the Widow Douglas’. She’ll have ice-cream! She has it most\n",
            "      every day—dead loads of it. And she’ll be awful glad to have\n",
            "      us.”“Oh, that will be fun!”Then Becky reflected a moment and said:“But what will mamma say?”“How’ll she ever know?”The girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:“I reckon it’s wrong—but—”“But shucks! Your mother won’t know, and so what’s the\n",
            "      harm? All she wants is that you’ll be safe; and I bet you she’d\n",

            "      Tom’s persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided to\n",
            "      say nothing to anybody about the night’s programme. Presently it\n",
            "      occurred to Tom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give the\n",
            "      signal. The thought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations.\n",
            "      Still he could not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas’. And\n",
            "      why should he give it up, he reasoned—the signal did not come the\n",
            "      night before, so why should it be any more likely to come tonight? The\n",
            "      sure fun of the evening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-like,\n",
            "      he determined to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself\n",
            "      to think of the box of money another time that day.Three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody\n",
            "      hollow and tied up. The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest distances\n",
            "      and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and laughter. All\n",
            "      the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone through with, and\n",
            "      by-and-by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified with responsible\n",
            "      appetites, and then the destruction of the good things began. After the\n",
            "      feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in the shade of\n",
            "      spreading oaks. By-and-by somebody shouted:“Who’s ready for the cave?”Everybody was. Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway there was\n",
            "      a general scamper up the hill. The mouth of the cave was up the hillside—an\n",
            "      opening shaped like a letter A. Its massive oaken door stood unbarred.\n",
            "      Within was a small chamber, chilly as an icehouse, and walled by Nature\n",
            "      with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat. It was romantic and\n",
            "      mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out upon the green\n",
            "      valley shining in the sun. But the impressiveness of the situation quickly\n",
            "      wore off, and the romping began again. The moment a candle was lighted\n",
            "      there was a general rush upon the owner of it; a struggle and a gallant\n",
            "      defence followed, but the candle was soon knocked down or blown out, and\n",
            "      then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a new chase. But all things\n",
            "      have an end. By-and-by the procession went filing down the steep descent\n",
            "      of the main avenue, the flickering rank of lights dimly revealing the\n",
            "      lofty walls of rock almost to their point of junction sixty feet overhead.\n",
            "      This main avenue was not more than eight or ten feet wide. Every few steps\n",
            "      other lofty and still narrower crevices branched from it on either hand—for\n",
            "      McDougal’s cave was but a vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran\n",
            "      into each other and out again and led nowhere. It was said that one might\n",
            "      wander days and nights together through its intricate tangle of rifts and\n",
            "      chasms, and never find the end of the cave; and that he might go down, and\n",
            "      down, and still down, into the earth, and it was just the same—labyrinth\n",
            "      under labyrinth, and no end to any of them. No man “knew” the\n",
            "      cave. That was an impossible thing. Most of the young men knew a portion\n",
            "      of it, and it was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion.\n",
            "      Tom Sawyer knew as much of the cave as any one.The procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters of a mile,\n",
            "      and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch avenues, fly\n",
            "      along the dismal corridors, and take each other by surprise at points\n",
            "      where the corridors joined again. Parties were able to elude each other\n",
            "      for the space of half an hour without going beyond the “known”\n",
            "      ground.By-and-by, one group after another came straggling back to the mouth of\n",
            "      the cave, panting, hilarious, smeared from head to foot with tallow\n",
            "      drippings, daubed with clay, and entirely delighted with the success of\n",

            "      the wasted time but the captain of the craft.Huck was already upon his watch when the ferryboat’s lights went\n",
            "      glinting past the wharf. He heard no noise on board, for the young people\n",

            "      then he dropped her out of his mind and put his attention upon his\n",
            "      business. The night was growing cloudy and dark. Ten o’clock came,\n",

            "      Eleven o’clock came, and the tavern lights were put out; darkness\n",
            "      everywhere, now. Huck waited what seemed a weary long time, but nothing\n",
